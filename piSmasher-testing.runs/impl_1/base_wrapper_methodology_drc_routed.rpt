XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-from : [get_pins -hier -filter {name =~ *i_MANAGEMENT/DUPLEX_MODE_REG*/C }]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '13' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).
